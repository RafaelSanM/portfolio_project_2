<h1>Triad Quiz - Website</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1> 

Project milestone 2: HTML/CSS/JavaScript Essentials - Code Institute Full-Stack development program.

Triad Quiz is a quiz game that allows players to test their knowledge in different topics. In Triad Quiz there are 3 different quizzes available and it has 10 questions for each topic. If the user can answer the question correctly they will receive points. It is a good way to have fun and also to learn while playing a game.

<h2>Colour Scheme</h2>

![](./src/images/images_read.me/color-scheme.png)

The main color scheme I chose for this project is a two-tone blue. The left side of the screen is lighter and the tone changes to a darker blue towards the right side of the screen. I chose a black color for the main container and the same blue as the background color when the user hovers over the quiz links as an interactive color. Green is the color used in the background color when the user gets the answer right and red is the color used in the background color when the user gets the answer wrong.

<h2>Typography</h2>

  - The Inter, sans-serif is used as the main font for the website.
  - Lexend Deca, sans-serif is used in the left-hand container information paragraph on the Homepage.

<h2>Imagery</h2> 

  - 3 Images were used for the aside menu. <br>
  - 1 image was used for the Favicon.

<h2>Interactive Links</h2>
  At the side menu of the Home page, users can access the social links (Github and Linked-in). Once these icons are clicked they open a new tab. Users can also click on an envelop image link that takes them to the contact page.

<h1>Features</h1>
