Triad Quiz is a quiz game that allows players to test their knowledge in different topics. In Triad Quiz there are 3 different quizzes available and it has 10 questions for each topic.

<h2>User Experience </h2>

- As a website developer, I'd like to: <br> <br>
  1. Develop an online quiz  that is visually appealing from the userâ€™s first visit so they are intrigued to explore and play the game. <br>
  2. Develop an easy to navigate quiz and game for its users to play. <br>
  3. Develop a quiz that is both attractive and challenging for the user. <br> <br>
- As a first visitor, I'd like to: <br> <br>
  1. Be able to understand the main purpose of the game. <br>
  2. Be able to easily navigate throughout the game and choose a quiz to play. <br>
  3. Be able to see my results after playing the game. <br> <br>
- As a returning visitor, I want to: <br> <br>
  1. Be able to find new quizzes when they are available. <br>
  2. Be able to check the Scores page. <br>
  3. Be able to challenge myself and improve on my scores.
